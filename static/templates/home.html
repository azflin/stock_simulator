    <h3>Rules/Help:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All portfolios start with $100,000. You can create an unlimited number of portfolios.
        </li>
        <li>
          Valid securities you can buy are tickers appearing on Yahoo Finance without punctuation.
          This limits you to mostly U.S. securities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shorting IS allowed on all securities. To short, place a "Sell" transaction of a security
          you don't own.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your total equity must be > 150% of your short exposure. With $100,000 in equity, your
            maximum short exposure is $200,000.
